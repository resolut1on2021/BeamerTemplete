abstract = {This research presents the power performance of the backward-bent duct buoy (BBDB) oscillating water column (OWC) wave energy converters (WECs). To achieve that, following steps are detailed: firstly, power conversion from wave power into pneumatic power by coupling the hydrodynamics and the thermodynamics in the air chamber using a linear air turbine power take-off (PTO), with the calculation of the power response curves for the1 BBDB OWC device in regular waves; secondly, using the power response curve, a power performance curve is then calculated for irregular waves; thirdly, the power matrices for the device is calculated and the determination of the rated power for the device to meet the target capture factor; and finally, the annual energy production will be assessed as the final indicator for the device's power performance. Using the developed approach, some initial optimisations are made to the original design. It is shown that with some simple optimisations, the BBDB OWC device could increase the annual energy production (AEP) significantly. A simple change in making a uniformed water column for the RM6 device could increase the AEP by about 10%, whilst increasing the horizontal duct length by 10â€¯m could increase the AEP by 58%.}

abstract = {In this paper, the development of Backward Bent Duct Buoy (BBDB) wave energy conversion technology in China is summarized. Novel ideas, new testing data and the improved performance of the BBDB conversion technology are presented. The latest large-scale model experimental results show that the peak wave-to-wire conversion efficiency of a new BBDB device is 42.0% under regular waves and it is 27.1% under random waves with the load of the battery. By comparison with the experimental and sea trial results of Japan's "Mighty Whale", the BBDB prototypes based on the experimental results of the new BBDB model present many advantages. If equipped with the latest air turbine, the conversion efficiency from pneumatic power to electric power of which is nearly 60% in sea trial, the efficiency from wave to wire of the new BBDB converter has the potential to exceed 50% in real sea waves, which is much higher than that of many other wave energy conversion technologies.}
